Ex. 3.2.1 (**) - FizzBuzz
*Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the
 number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
 "FizzBuzz".


 // Solution

    Step-1 Crete a Loop through the number 1 to 100.
        
    Step-2    
        For each number check:
            If the current number can be divided by 3 without any rest(reminder is equal zero) (also known as   
                modulo) as well as it can be divided by 5 without any rest, then print "FizzBuzz".
            If the current number is divisible by 3, but not by 5 (returns a rest), then print "Fizz".
            If the current number is divisible by 5, but not by 3 (returns a rest), then print "Buzz".
            In any other case just print the currentNumber.
