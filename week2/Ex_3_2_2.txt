Ex. 3.2.2 
Write a program that asks the user for a date. Find the day of the year for the given date. For example,
January 1st would be 1, and December 31st is 365.
    a- Do not include leap years.
    b- Include leap years. Check the rules for leap years on the internet, and implement them in your program.


// Solution 

    FUNCTION isLeapYear(year):
        IF (year MOD 4 == 0 AND year MOD 100 != 0) OR (year MOD 400 == 0):
            RETURN TRUE
        ELSE:
            RETURN FALSE

    FUNCTION getDayOfYear(month, day, year):
        // Days in each month
        DEFINE daysInMonth AS ARRAY [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
        
        // Check for leap year
        IF isLeapYear(year):
            daysInMonth[1] = 29  // February has 29 days in a leap year

        // Calculate the day of the year
        dayOfYear = 0
        FOR i FROM 0 TO month - 1:
            dayOfYear = dayOfYear + daysInMonth[i]
        
        dayOfYear = dayOfYear + day
        RETURN dayOfYear

    // Main program
    PROMPT "Enter the date (format: MM/DD/YYYY):"
    READ inputDate
    PARSE inputDate INTO month, day, year

    // Validate the date input
    IF month < 1 OR month > 12 OR day < 1 OR day > 31:
        PRINT "Invalid date. Please enter a valid date."
        EXIT

    IF (month == 2 AND day > 29) OR (month IN [4, 6, 9, 11] AND day > 30):
        PRINT "Invalid date. Please enter a valid date."
        EXIT

    dayOfYear = getDayOfYear(month, day, year)
    PRINT "The day of the year is: " + dayOfYear
