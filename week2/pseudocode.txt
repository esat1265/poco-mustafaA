Ex.3 - One family wants to get through a tunnel. Dad can make it in 1 minute, mama in 2 minutes, son in 4 and daughter in 5 minutes. Unfortunately, not more than two persons can go through the narrow tunnel at one time, moving at the speed of the slower one.
Can they all make it to the other side if they have a torch that lasts only 12 minutes and they are afraid of the dark?
=======================================

    Define the family members and their crossing times
    SET dad_time = 1
    SET mama_time = 2
    SET son_time = 4
    SET daughter_time = 5

    Initialize total time
    SET total_time = 0

    Step 1: Dad and Mama cross the tunnel
    total_time = total_time + mama_time   // Slowest time (Mama)
    PRINT "Dad and Mama cross. Total time: ", total_time

    Step 2: Dad returns with the torch
    total_time = total_time + dad_time
    PRINT "Dad returns. Total time: ", total_time

    Step 3: Son and Daughter cross the tunnel
    total_time = total_time + daughter_time  // Slowest time (Daughter)
    PRINT "Son and Daughter cross. Total time: ", total_time

    Step 4: Mama returns with the torch
    total_time = total_time + mama_time
    PRINT "Mama returns. Total time: ", total_time

    Step 5: Dad and Mama cross the tunnel again
    total_time = total_time + mama_time
    PRINT "Dad and Mama cross again. Total time: ", total_time

    Check if total time is within the limit
    IF total_time <= 12 THEN
        PRINT "All family members made it across the tunnel in ", total_time, " minutes."
    ELSE
        PRINT "Failed to get everyone across in time."
    END IF

Ex.2 - Allow the user to input digits, afterwards sort and print them in numerical order.
===================================================
BEGIN

    Step 1: Initialize an empty list to store the digits
    DECLARE digitsList AS LIST

    Step 2: Prompt the user for input
    PRINT "Enter digits separated by spaces: "
    
    Step 3: Read the input from the user
    READ userInput
    
    Step 4: Split the input string into individual digits
    SET digitsList = SPLIT(userInput INTO LIST OF DIGITS)

    Step 5: Sort the list of digits in numerical order
    SORT digitsList IN ASCENDING ORDER

    Step 6: Print the sorted digits
    PRINT "Sorted digits in numerical order: "
    FOR EACH digit IN digitsList DO
        PRINT digit
    END FOR
