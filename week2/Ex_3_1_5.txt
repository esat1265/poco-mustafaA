Ex. 3.1.5 (*) - Combine

*Combine Ex. 3.1.2 and 3.1.4 into one program.
 The program should ask the user if they want to add or subtract two numbers. Then the program should ask
 for the two numbers and print the result.

 // Solution

    DECLARE variable --> number_1 AS Number;
    DECLARE variable --> number_2 AS Number;
    DECLARE variable --> operation AS String;

    step-1 PROMPT "Please choose your operation by typinf a letter: Add: A, Subtract: S" AS operation;

    step-2 Check if user choose A or B. If not, ask again for choosing a correct letter for step 1.


    step-3 // DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
                       
        IF operation is A;
            Execute program call(Ex_3_1_2.txt)
        ELSE
            Execute program call(Ex_3_1_4.txt)
        END
