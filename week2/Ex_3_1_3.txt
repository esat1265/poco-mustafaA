Ex. 3.1.3 (*) - Which number is bigger?

Declare 2 variables, both numbers. Compare which number is greater Log the output, e.g. "The greater number
of 5 and 10 is 10." Add an output for the else statement, e.g. "The smaller number of 5 and 10 is 5."

// Solution

    DECLARE variable --> number_1 AS Number;
    DECLARE variable --> number_2 AS Number;

    step-1 PROMPT "Please input first number" AS number_1;
    step-2 PROMPT "Please input second number" AS number_2;

    step-3 Check if all the inputs are numbers. If not, ask for the numbers again and return to step 1 or 2.


    step-4 // compare number_1 and number_2;
    
            function compare(number_1, number_2)
                
                IF number_1 is equal number_2;
                    display "These numbers are equals"
                ELSEIF number_1 is greater then number_2;
                    display "The greater number of number_1 and number_2 is number_1."
                ELSE
                    display "The smaller number of number_1 and number_2 is number_1."
            
            END
